# Changeset scenarios & examples

## Bug fix

```markdown
---
"arkenv": patch
---

#### Fix category parent reference not being set during deployment

Categories with parent slugs now correctly link to their parent categories during the deploy operation.
```

## New feature (non-breaking, v0)

````markdown
---
"arkenv": patch
---

#### Add `arkenv` for type-safe environment variables

The new `arkenv` function allows you to define your environment schema using ArkType.

Usage:

```ts
import arkenv from "arkenv"
import { type } from "arktype"

const env = arkenv({
  schema: {
    PORT: type.number.parseable()
  }
})

console.log(env.PORT) // number
```
````

## Breaking change (v0)

````markdown
---
"arkenv": minor
---

#### Change configuration format for validators

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Validator options are now passed as a second argument to `arkenv`.

Before:
```ts
arkenv({ schema, strict: true })
```

After:
```ts
arkenv({ schema }, { strict: true })
```

Migration: Update your `arkenv` calls to separate the options from the schema configuration.
