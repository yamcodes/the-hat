# Changeset & release manager

## Overview

Automate the creation and modification of changesets following project conventions, ensuring proper version bumps and well-documented release notes.

## When to use

- After completing a feature or fix
- Before creating a PR
- When updating or correcting an existing changeset
- When preparing a release
- To document breaking changes

## What is a changeset?

A changeset is a markdown file in the `.changeset/` directory that describes:

1. Which packages are affected
2. What type of version bump (patch/minor/major)
3. A description of the change

## Changeset types

| Type    | When to Use in v0 (Current)               | When to Use in v1+                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `patch` | Any non-breaking change (fixes, features) | Non-breaking bug fixes                    |
| `minor` | **Breaking changes**                      | Non-breaking new features                 |
| `major` | Switch to v1 (only when instructed)       | **Breaking changes**                      |

\* In v0, `minor` is used for **breaking changes**, not features.
\*\* In v0, `major` is used only when explicitly transitioning to v1.

## Decision guide

> **Current Status:** The ArkEnv monorepo is in **v1 prerelease mode** (alpha). All packages follow **standard SemVer (v1+ rules)**.

### Use `patch` for:

- Bug fixes
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Performance improvements
- Code style/linting fixes
- Small documentation corrections

### Use `minor` for:

- **New features** (new CLI commands, new configuration options, enhanced functionality, non-breaking API additions, etc.)
- New exports or public APIs
- Significant documentation improvements

### Use `major` for:

- **Breaking changes** (any modification that requires consumers to change their code). You MUST include a `**BREAKING CHANGE**:` note at the bottom of the changeset with migration instructions.

**Note**: Purely internal refactorings (e.g., library switches, internal type cleanup) that offer no tangible benefit or change to the consumer should NOT be documented in a changeset. Do not clutter the changelog with changes that are meaningless to the end user.

## v0 Rules (Legacy / Reference Only)

Use these rules only when working with packages still at `0.y.z` that are **not** in v1 prerelease mode:

### Use `patch` for:

- **Any non-breaking change** (including new features, bug fixes, dependency updates, performance improvements, etc.)

### Use `minor` ONLY for:

- **Breaking changes** (Required in v0 for any breaking modification. You MUST prefix the description with `**BREAKING CHANGE**:`).

### Use `major` ONLY for:

- Explicitly transitioning the project from v0.x.y to v1.0.0. **Only use major when explicitly instructed to switch/transition to v1.**

## Decision guide (v1+ rules)

For packages in **v1+** (e.g. active `v1` branch):

### Use `patch` for:
- Backward-compatible bug fixes
- Internal performance or refactor improvements with user value

### Use `minor` for:
- Backward-compatible new features or API additions

### Use `major` for:
- **Breaking changes** (Any change that breaks backward compatibility. You MUST prefix the description with `**BREAKING CHANGE**:`).

## Creating a changeset

### Title convention

- **Format**: All changeset descriptions MUST start with a `####` header.
- **Mood**: You MUST use the **imperative mood** for all headers, change summaries, and actions. Write changesets as commands to the codebase (e.g. "Add helper...", "Fix issue...", "Drop support..." instead of "Adds...", "Fixed...", "Drops..."). Any changeset using indicative ("Adds/fixes") or past tense ("Added/fixed") is strictly invalid.

### Usage examples

Always include usage examples or code snippets when adding new features or fixing bugs that affect how the library is used.

### Interactive method

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Select affected packages (space to select)
2. Choose bump type for each package
3. Write a summary of changes (remember to start with `####`)

### Manual method

Create a file in `.changeset/` with a random name:

````markdown
---
"arkenv": patch
---

#### Add `arkenv` helper for improved type inference

Usage:

```ts
import arkenv from "arkenv"
import { type } from "arktype"

export const env = arkenv({
  schema: {
    NODE_ENV: type("'development' | 'production' | 'test'"),
    PORT: type.number.parseable()
  }
})
```
````

### File format

```markdown
---
"package-name": patch|minor|major
---

#### Imperative title of the change (e.g., "Add helper" - MUST be imperative mood)

A concise, technical description of the change (using the imperative mood for action summaries). Keep it brief, avoid long prose or bullet points, and provide code snippets/usage examples where helpful.

Include:
- **Usage examples** (code blocks)
- Bullet points for details
- Migration instructions for breaking changes (using `major` bump and you MUST include a `**BREAKING CHANGE**:` note at the bottom)

**Note**: Do NOT reference GitHub issues (e.g., #123) directly in the changeset. Changesets will automatically be linked to the PR and commits during the release process.
**BREAKING CHANGE**: Place migration instructions or descriptions of breaking changes (using the `**BREAKING CHANGE**:` label) at the **end** of the changeset. Keep it concise - 1-2 lines max, 3 lines absolute maximum. Prefer using ```diff blocks to visually demonstrate syntax/behavior changes.
```


## Modifying an existing changeset

### When to modify

- The bump type is wrong (e.g., used `minor` for a patch-level change)
- The description uses past or indicative tense instead of imperative mood
- Usage examples are missing or incorrect
- The changeset references GitHub issues directly
- A change is documented that should be excluded (internal-only refactoring with no consumer value)
- Multiple related changes exist across separate changesets that should be combined

### Process

1. **Read** the existing changeset file from `.changeset/`
2. **Assess** what needs to change: bump type, description, examples, or scope
3. **Edit** the file directly - changesets are plain markdown files
4. **Remove** the file entirely if the changeset no longer applies (e.g., the change was reverted)

### Validation checklist after modification

- [ ] Bump type matches the decision guide (patch/minor for non-breaking, major for breaking)
- [ ] Title starts with `####` header
- [ ] All descriptions use imperative mood (no past tense, no indicative)
- [ ] Usage examples present for user-facing changes
- [ ] No GitHub issue references (# numbers)
- [ ] Breaking changes use `major` bump and include a `**BREAKING CHANGE**:` note at the bottom

## Release workflow

### 1. Create or modify changeset

```bash
# Create
pnpm changeset

# Or modify manually
# Edit .changeset/<name>.md directly
```

### 2. PR and review

- Changeset is part of the feature PR targeting the `dev` branch
- Reviewers can suggest bump type changes or edits

### 3. Merge to dev

- Merging a feature PR containing a changeset to `dev` triggers the Changesets GitHub Action
- The action automatically creates or updates a "Version Packages" PR targeting the `dev` branch (since `baseBranch` is set to `dev` in `.changeset/config.json`)
- This "Version Packages" PR contains all accumulated version updates and CHANGELOG entries

### 4. Merge version PR

- Merging the "Version Packages" PR on `dev` triggers the publication of bumped packages to npm
- Upon successful publish, the release workflow programmatically fast-forwards the `main` branch to `dev` (`git merge dev --ff-only`) and pushes it
- The push to `main` triggers the production documentation website

## Pre-release versions

For managing alpha, beta, and release candidate (rc) pre-releases, we follow a strict versioning policy using the `alpha` ➔ `beta` ➔ `rc` progression.

To avoid duplication, the exact pre-release branching strategies, command workflows, and SemVer naming rules are documented in the [Contributing Guide](file:///Users/yamcodes/code/arkenv/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#use-case-4-coordinating-a-major-version-eg-v1).

## Checking status

```bash
# See what changesets exist
npx changeset status

# Preview version bump
npx changeset version --dry-run

# List all changeset files
ls .changeset/*.md
```

## Common mistakes

| Mistake               | Issue               | Fix                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Wrong bump type       | Unexpected version  | Review decision guide above                      |
| Vague description     | Poor CHANGELOG      | Be specific about changes                        |
| Missing changeset     | No release notes    | Always add before PR                             |
| Past tense in body    | Style violation     | Rewrite in imperative mood                       |
| Not including context | Hard to understand  | Explain *why* not just *what*                    |
| Meaningless changes   | Cluttered CHANGELOG | Only document changes with consumer value        |
| Including issue links | Redundant data      | Remove # references; PR links them automatically |
