# <Problem title>

Living evaluation, not an ADR. Update this file as options enter or leave the hat. Promoted decisions belong in `docs/adr/`.

**Status:** working note for `#<issue>` / PR `#<pr>`. **Chosen public story:** <S stack, or “undecided”>.

## Problem

<What must be true when we are done — not the first idea that showed up.>

## Layer map

- **<Layer A>:** <dimension — items here are substitutes for each other>
- **<Layer B>:** <a different dimension; composes with Layer A>

Items on different layers compose. Do not flatten into one list.

## Metrics

| Metric | Question |
| ------ | -------- |
|        |          |

## The hat

### <Layer A — dimension>

| # | Option | Notes |
| - | ------ | ----- |
| A1 | | Include rejected and out-of-scope options so they get scored. |

### <Layer B — dimension>

| # | Option | Notes |
| - | ------ | ----- |
| B1 | | |

## Evaluation

**<id> <name>** — Prose against the metrics. Not a vibe rank. For a close call, a comparison table is welcome.

## Tier list

Solutions ranked as **answers to the whole problem**. Some are complete; some are pieces. A complete answer may be a **stack** (one pick per layer).

**S (chosen / default story)**
- **<stack>** — why this is the public story

**A (Icebox)**
- Optional tuck-away or distribution. Not a blocker. Do not ship these to close the current change unless they are required.

**B** / **C** / **D** / **E** as needed.

## S and A usage

### Use case 1: <name>

**S:**
```text
concrete usage
```

**A:**
```text
concrete usage
```

Repeat for each real use case. The ranking is not abstract.

## Current lean

<What ships now. What stays A-tier and is not required to close the change.>
